# Woya Game
Openclassroom's sixth project where I was to build a turn-based 2-player game. Key features that were to be implemented are listed below.

1. 2 seperate players randomly generated on the board.
2. Different ground tiles, some of which must be non-traversable (randomly generated). 
3. a Minimum of 3 Different weapons (randomly generated).
4. A final fighting sequence when players land on squares adjacent to each other.

I decided to build the project using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and include a mini boss fight when a player steps on one of the randomly generated squares to trigger a random weapon drop upon defeating the boss.

Note: the boss will die in 3 hits for demonstration purposes.

IMPORTANT: The game must be run on the latest version of Google Chrome.
